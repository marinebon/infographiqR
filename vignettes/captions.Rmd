There are 3 types of captions that can be included on a modal popup:

1. modal_top - caption at the top of the popup (before all the plots)
2. modal_bottom - caption after all the plots
3. plot_caption - caption that immediately follows a particular plot

Here are the basic steps for adding captions to an infographic chart modal popup.

1. create a file for each caption
2. include the path to the new file in plot_indicators.csv (for plot_caption) or svg_elements.csv (for modal_top or modal_bottom)
